{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<p>I've been with Rebecca and Ben for 1 year now. I was left behind by my previous humans when they moved. I was outside and it was really cold. they brought me in. They fed me, got me checked out by a vet, and now I live like a king. </p>\n<p>I stay warm, get lots of food and treats. I like to play in my tunnel, chase poms, attack ankles, wrestle and snuggle up on my cat tree or my favorite blanket on the couch. I get to watch tv and look out the big window. I love watching other animals and all the activity outside.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"One Year With My Humans"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/one-year/"}}
